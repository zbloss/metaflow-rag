{"text": "Generative AI is significantly impacting the infrastructure that machine learning developers need access to. For example, generative models require large amounts of high-quality training data, which can require specialized data storage and processing systems to handle the large datasets and computational requirements. Additionally, generative models often rely on large-scale distributed computing systems, such as cloud computing platforms, to process and generate large amounts of data quickly and efficiently.\n\nAs a result, the infrastructure required to support generative AI is becoming increasingly sophisticated and specialized. Machine learning developers need access to large amounts of training data, high-performance computing resources, and specialized data storage and processing systems to effectively develop and use generative models. Additionally, developers may need to be skilled in working with large-scale distributed computing systems to effectively utilize the power of these generative models."}
