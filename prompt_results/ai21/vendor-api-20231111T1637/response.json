{"text": "Generative AI, which includes technologies such as machine learning, deep learning, and reinforcement learning, has the potential to significantly impact the infrastructure that machine learning developers need access to. For example, with greater access to advanced computing resources and larger data sets, developers can explore more complex models and algorithms, leading to improved accuracy and performance. Additionally, advancements in data storage and management may be needed to handle the increasing volume of data and the complexity of models. Furthermore, with the rise of cloud-based platforms and services, developers may increasingly able to access these tools and capabilities from remote servers, making it easier to experiment and deploy AI solutions."}
