Increased demand for processing power and storage: Generative AI models, particularly deep learning models, require a lot of data and processing power to train and use. This has led to an increased demand for cloud-based infrastructure and high-performance computing resources.\n2. Changes in data storage and management: Generative AI models often require large amounts of data to train and use effectively. This has led to changes in the way data is stored and managed, with more focus on data lakes and other scalable storage solutions.\n3. Increased demand for specialized hardware: Some generative AI applications, such as natural language processing and computer vision, require specialized hardware such as graphics processing units (GPUs) or tensor processing units (TPUs) to run efficiently. This has led to an increased demand for these specialized hardware components.\n4. Changes in software architecture: Generative AI models often require large amounts of data and processing power to train and use effectively. This has led to changes in software architecture, with more focus on modularity and scalability.\n\nOverall, the rise of generative AI is affecting the infrastructure of machine learning by increasing the demand for scalable, high-performance computing resources and specialized hardware. It is also leading to changes in data storage and management and software architecture to accommodate these demands. ", "likelihood": null, "finish_reason": "COMPLETE"}
