Increased demand for computing power: Generative AI models, particularly at larger scales, require significant amounts of computing power to train and use. This has resulted in increased demand for specialized hardware, such as GPUs and TPUs, as well as for cloud computing services that provide access to large amounts of computing power.\n2. Storage requirements: Generative AI models can be large and require significant amounts of storage to store the model parameters and the data used to train the model. This has resulted in increased demand for high-performance storage solutions, such as solid-state drives and cloud storage services.\n3. Data requirements: Generative AI models require large amounts of data to train effectively. This has resulted in increased demand for data collection and curation tools, as well as for data storage and management solutions.\n4. Algorithm requirements: Generative AI models require complex algorithms to train and use effectively. This has resulted in increased demand for research into new algorithms and for development of open-source software and libraries that provide access to these algorithms.\n\nOverall, the rise of generative AI has placed increased demands on the infrastructure of machine learning, requiring more computing power, storage, data, and algorithms.", "likelihood": null, "finish_reason": "COMPLETE"}
